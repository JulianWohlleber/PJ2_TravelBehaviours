<p>This was probably one of the hardest task, I had in this course. The task was to generate Data and do a Datavisualisation with it, which should later be published on a Webpage online.</p>

<p>After some time thinking, I decided to generate a Survey about the daily travel distances and their impact on the transportation-method and the effects of health. I generated the Survey with Google Survey, because Google Survey offers the best ways to publish the generated data, which later was really relevant for the built of the Html-Page.<br>

<p>When I started to write the Webpage, I first was really really lost. I never had made any experience before with html, much less I had never heard of css. The only thing that I understood a little was java script with the help of p5, which is a library that makes java script feel and work pretty similar to processing.
When I succeeded after a few hours to built a Webpage like I wanted it (Html only, no Java Script, precasted css), I decided to start with the java script part. After hours of work, I had... yeah - actually still nothing. I simply didn't understand arrays, and how I could use the contend of the google spreadsheet in my code. After some more time struggeling I felt really low, and decided to just built the Visualisation manually with Illustrater, export the document as a PDF and and just implement that into my webpage.  I wasn't really proud of this solution, but I just didn't had the time to finish it properly.  </p>

<a id="finish" class="anchor" href="#finish" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Finish</h2>

<p>When my vacation started and I had done all my dokus for my other subjects, I decided to finish what I started so far. After an 8-hour-youtube-course I understood the basics of java script. I could now use arrays, link a java script into html, link buttons of a html page to java script (after some time of practise), and after some more hours of research was able to use the data of the online spreadsheet via tabletop.<br>
I searched for a nice css, built the html page, and after a lot of time, also finished the java script.<br>
I'm really proud that I've built my first Webpage, and I'm happy, that I invested so much time, because coding seems to be like reading or writing. Once you've learned something, you do not forget it, or at least learn it fast again.<br>
There are still some issues I had with the page, for example that I wasn't able to fit the Canvas into the window-width, which sometimes generates unlovely grades between the html section and the canvas, but I think I should be able to fix this in some time.</p>
